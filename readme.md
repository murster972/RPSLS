# RPSLS Game
My Submission for the Arnold Clark 2019 Hackathon tech test.

An implementation of the game "rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock".

## Game Modes
There are two game modes avaible: normal and arcade

### Normal
the "traditonal" version of the game. The player uses their mouse or keyboard to select an option, a random opponent value is generated, and finally the results are displayed.

### Arcade
The player has to select an option that "defeats" the option displayed, before the timer runs out; everytime they select a correct value the score is increased by one and the timer speeds up. If the player chooses an incorrect value or the timer runs out they lose, and a "game-over" page is displayed with the players score.

## Rules
